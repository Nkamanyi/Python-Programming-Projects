Question 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)
future_year = 100 - age
print(name + " you will turn 100 years old in " + str(future_year) + " years time.")

#data from input() function is string even if the data is a number.
#To do arithmetic calculation, the number needs to be converted to integer using int().
#We can only add strings (concatenation) and not string and integer.

Question2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

num = input("Enter a number: ")
if int(num) % 2 == 0:
    print(num + " is an even number.")
else:
    print(num + " is an odd number.")
    
Question 3
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
for num in a:
    if num < 5:
        print(num)
        
Question 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

range_of_list = range(1,num+1)
list_of_divisors = []

for number in range_of_list:
    if num % number == 0:
        list_of_divisors.append(number)
        
print(list_of_divisors)

Question 5
Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

list_of_common_numbers = []

for num in b:
    if num in a:
        list_of_common_numbers.append(num)

print(list_of_common_numbers)

# If statement also search for elemnts in a different list.

Question 6
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

name = input("Enter the name of an animal: ")

reverse = name[::-1]
print(reverse)
if name == reverse:
    print(name + "is a palindrome")
else:
    print(name + "is not a palindrome")
#[:] use this to read all the elemnts in a list
#[::2] use this to count how often you read the elements in a list moving forward.
#[::-1] use this to count how often you read the elements in a list moving backward.

Question 7
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
list_of_even_num = []
for num in a:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        list_of_even_num.append(num)

print(list_of_even_num)

#To write the same code in one line of python,

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

list_of_even_num = [num for num in a if num % 2 ==0]

print(list_of_even_num)

Question 8

import random

random_num = random.randint(1,9)
guess_num = int(input("Enter a guess number: "))

if guess_num == random_num:
    print("You guessed exactly right.")
    
elif guess_num > random_num:
    print("You guessed too high.")
    
else:
    print("You guessed too low.")
    
Question 9
Generate two lists of random numbers and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this using at least one list comprehension.

import random

a = random.sample(range(1, 90),12)
print(a)
b = random.sample(range(1, 90),14)
print(b)

list_of_common_num = [num for num in b if num in a]

print(list_of_common_num)

Question 10
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.

import random

samp = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#$%^&*()?"
passw = " ".join(random.sample(samp, 8))
print(passw)

    print("The down payment is $" + down_payment1)
else:
    print("The down payment is $" + down_payment2)

Question 12
If name is less than 3 character long, print name must be at least 3 characters. otherwise if it is more 50 characters long, print name can be a maximum of 50 characters. otherwise, name looks good.

nam = input("Enter your name: ")

if len(nam) < 3:
    print("Name must be at least 3 characters.")

else:
    print("Name looks good.")
    
Question 13

Question 37
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

def reverse_words(text):
    return " ".join(i[::-1] for i in text.split(" "))

    return True
  else:
    return False

print(is_uppercase("The Lord is good"))

Question 43
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.
For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

def square_sum(numbers):
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in numbers)

print(square_sum([1, 2, 7, 10, 2]))

or 

def square_sum(numbers):
  sum = 0
  for num in numbers:
       sum += num ** 2
  return sum
  
print(square_sum([1, 2, 7, 10, 2]))

Question 45
There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.
You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!

Note:
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

import statistics

    return your_points > sum(class_points) / len(class_points)
    
print(better_than_average([12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 90], 69))

Question 46
Write a method smash that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

def smash(words):
    return " ".join(words)
    
print(smash(['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']))

Question 47
Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

if x>y - 3 points
if x<y - 0 point
if x=y - 1 point
Notes:

there are 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4

def points(games):
    count = 0
    for score in games:
        res = score.split(':')
        if res[0]>res[1]:
            count += 3
        elif res[0] == res[1]:
            count += 1
    return count
print(point(["3:1", "2:2", "0:1"]))

or

def points(games):
    return sum(3 if x > y else 0 if x < y else 1 for x, y in (score.split(":") for score in games))

Question 49
Suzuki is a monk who climbs a large staircase to the monastery as part of a ritual. Some days he climbs more stairs than others depending on the number of students he must train in the morning. He is curious how many stairs might be climbed over the next 20 years and has spent a year marking down his daily progress.

The sum of all the stairs logged in a year will be used for estimating the number he might climb in 20.

20_year_estimate = one_year_total * 20

You will receive the following data structure representing the stairs Suzuki logged in a year. You will have all data for the entire year so regardless of how it is logged the problem should be simple to solve.

stairs = [sunday,monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday,saturday]
Make sure your solution takes into account all of the nesting within the stairs array.

Each weekday in the stairs array is an array.

sunday = [6737, 7244, 5776, 9826, 7057, 9247, 5842, 5484, 6543, 5153, 6832, 8274, 7148, 6152, 5940, 8040, 9174, 7555, 7682, 5252, 8793, 8837, 7320, 8478, 6063, 5751, 9716, 5085, 7315, 7859, 6628, 5425, 6331, 7097, 6249, 8381, 5936, 8496, 6934, 8347, 7036, 6421, 6510, 5821, 8602, 5312, 7836, 8032, 9871, 5990, 6309, 7825]
Your function should return the 20 year estimate of the stairs climbed using the formula above.

def stairs_in_20(stairs):
    total = 0
    for day in stairs:
        for num in day:
            total += num
    return total * 20
