Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)
future_year = 100 - age
print(name + " you will turn 100 years old in " + str(future_year) + " years time.")

#data from input() function is string even if the data is a number.
#To do arithmetic calculation, the number needs to be converted to integer using int.
#We can only add strings (concatenation) and not string and integer.
