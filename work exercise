Question 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)
future_year = 100 - age
print(name + " you will turn 100 years old in " + str(future_year) + " years time.")

#data from input() function is string even if the data is a number.
#To do arithmetic calculation, the number needs to be converted to integer using int().
#We can only add strings (concatenation) and not string and integer.

Question2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

num = input("Enter a number: ")
if int(num) % 2 == 0:
    print(num + " is an even number.")
else:
    print(num + " is an odd number.")
    
Question 3
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
for num in a:
    if num < 5:
        print(num)
        
Question 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

range_of_list = range(1,num+1)
list_of_divisors = []

for number in range_of_list:
    if num % number == 0:
        list_of_divisors.append(number)
        
print(list_of_divisors)

Question 5
Take two lists, say for example these two:

  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

list_of_common_numbers = []

for num in b:
    if num in a:
        list_of_common_numbers.append(num)

print(list_of_common_numbers)

# If statement also search for elemnts in a different list.

Question 6
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

name = input("Enter the name of an animal: ")

reverse = name[::-1]
print(reverse)
if name == reverse:
    print(name + "is a palindrome")
else:
    print(name + "is not a palindrome")
#[:] use this to read all the elemnts in a list
#[::2] use this to count how often you read the elements in a list moving forward.
#[::-1] use this to count how often you read the elements in a list moving backward.

Question 7
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
list_of_even_num = []
for num in a:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        list_of_even_num.append(num)

print(list_of_even_num)

#To write the same code in one line of python,

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

list_of_even_num = [num for num in a if num % 2 ==0]

print(list_of_even_num)

Question 8

guess_num = int(input("Enter a guess number: "))

if guess_num == random_num:
    print("You guessed exactly right.")
    
elif guess_num > random_num:
    print("You guessed too high.")
    
else:
    print("You guessed too low.")
    
Question 9
Generate two lists of random numbers and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this using at least one list comprehension.

import random

a = random.sample(range(1, 90),12)
print(a)
b = random.sample(range(1, 90),14)
print(b)

list_of_common_num = [num for num in b if num in a]

print(list_of_common_num)

Question 10
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.

else:
    print("The down payment is $" + down_payment2)

Question 12

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

def square_sum(numbers):
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in numbers)

print(square_sum([1, 2, 7, 10, 2]))

or

Question 46
Write a method smash that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Question 49
Suzuki is a monk who climbs a large staircase to the monastery as part of a ritual. Some days he climbs more stairs than others depending on the number of students he must train in the morning. He is curious how many stairs might be climbed over the next 20 years and has spent a year marking down his daily progress.

The sum of all the stairs logged in a year will be used for estimating the number he might climb in 20.

20_year_estimate = one_year_total * 20

You will receive the following data structure representing the stairs Suzuki logged in a year. You will have all data for the entire year so regardless of how it is logged the problem should be simple to solve.

stairs = [sunday,monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday,saturday]
Make sure your solution takes into account all of the nesting within the stairs array.

Each weekday in the stairs array is an array.

sunday = [6737, 7244, 5776, 9826, 7057, 9247, 5842, 5484, 6543, 5153, 6832, 8274, 7148, 6152, 5940, 8040, 9174, 7555, 7682, 5252, 8793, 8837, 7320, 8478, 6063, 5751, 9716, 5085, 7315, 7859, 6628, 5425, 6331, 7097, 6249, 8381, 5936, 8496, 6934, 8347, 7036, 6421, 6510, 5821, 8602, 5312, 7836, 8032, 9871, 5990, 6309, 7825]
Your function should return the 20 year estimate of the stairs climbed using the formula above.

def stairs_in_20(stairs):
    total = 0
    for day in stairs:
        for num in day:

  Question 56
  Given 2 elevators (named "left" and "right") in a building with 3 floors (numbered 0 to 2), write a function elevator accepting 3 arguments (in order):

left - The current floor of the left elevator
right - The current floor of the right elevator
call - The floor that called an elevator
It should return the name of the elevator closest to the called floor ("left"/"right").

In the case where both elevators are equally distant from the called floor, choose the elevator to the right.

You can assume that the inputs will always be valid integers between 0-2.


  def elevator(left, right, call):
    return "left" if abs(call - left) < abs(call - right) else "right"
    
  print(elevator())

  print(elevator())
  
  Questions 57
  Write a function, gooseFilter/goose_filter/GooseFilter, that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a filtered array containing the same elements but with the 'geese' removed.

The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated in your solution:

geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"]
For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "African", "Crested", "Pilgrim", "Toulouse", "Blue Swedish"]
Your function would return the following array:

["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "Crested", "Blue Swedish"]
The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as in the initial array passed to your function, albeit with the 'geese' removed. Note that all of the strings will be in the same case as those provided, and some elements may be repeated.


geese = {"African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"}

def goose_filter(birds):
    return [bird for bird in birds if bird not in geese]
    
print(goode_filter())

def maps(a):
    return map(lambda w:2*w, a)

print(maps())

Question 62
Create a function with two arguments that will return a list of length (n) with multiples of (x).

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

Examples:

count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]

Question 68
You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example, if n = 10:

return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Question 69
Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases

def final_grade(exam, projects):
    if exam > 90 or projects > 10:
        return 100
    elif exam > 75 and projects >= 5:
        return 90
    elif exam > 50 and projects >= 2:
        return 75
   else:
        return 0

print(final_grade(90,7))

  return 0
  
print(final_grade(90,7))

Question 70
In this programming exercise, you're going to learn about functions, boolean (true/false) values, strings, and the if-statement.

A function is a block of code that takes an input and produces an output. In this example, boolean_to_string is a function whose input is either true or false, and whose output is the string representation of the input, either "true"/"True" or "false"/"False" (check the sample tests about what capitalization to use in a given language).

A common idea we often want to represent in code is the concept of true and false. A variable that can either be true or false is called a boolean variable. In this example, the input to boolean_to_string (represented by the variable b) is a boolean.

Lastly, when we want to take one action if a boolean is true, and another if it is false, we use an if-statement.

def boolean_to_string(b):
    return "True" if b else "False"

print(boolean_to_string())

or

def boolean_to_string(b):
    if b:
        return "True"
    else:
        return "False"
        
print(boolean_to_string())

def positive_sum(arr):
    return sum(x for x in arr if x > 0)
    
print(positive_sum([1,-4,7,12]))

Question 73
Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

print(litres(6))

Question 78
Create a function called that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

strCount('Hello', 'o') // => 1
strCount('Hello', 'l') // => 2
strCount('', 'z')      // => 0

def str_count(strng, letter):

Question 84
Don Drumphet lives in a nice neighborhood, but one of his neighbors has started to let his house go. Don Drumphet wants to build a wall between his house and his neighbor’s, and is trying to get the neighborhood association to pay for it. He begins to solicit his neighbors to petition to get the association to build the wall. Unfortunately for Don Drumphet, he cannot read very well, has a very limited attention span, and can only remember two letters from each of his neighbors’ names. As he collects signatures, he insists that his neighbors keep truncating their names until two letters remain, and he can finally read them.

Your code will show Full name of the neighbor and the truncated version of the name as an array. If the number of the characters in name is equal or less than two, it will return an array containing only the name as is"


def who_is_paying(name):
    return [name, name[:2]] if len(name) > 2 else [name]

  print(whatday(5))
  
  Question 90
  Give you two strings: s1 and s2. If they are opposite, return true; otherwise, return false. Note: The result should be a boolean value, instead of a string.

The opposite means: All letters of the two strings are the same, but the case is opposite. you can assume that the string only contains letters or it's a empty string. Also take note of the edge case - if both strings are empty then you should return false/False.

#Some examples:
isOpposite("ab","AB") should return true;
isOpposite("aB","Ab") should return true;
isOpposite("aBcd","AbCD") should return true;
isOpposite("AB","Ab") should return false;
isOpposite("","") should return false;

  
  def is_opposite(s1, s2):

  print(is_opposite())  
  
  Question 91
  You're on your way to the market when you hear beautiful music coming from a nearby street performer. The notes come together like you wouln't believe as the musician puts together patterns of tunes. As you wonder what kind of algorithm you could use to shift octaves by 8 pitches or something silly like that, it dawns on you that you have been watching the musician for some 10 odd minutes. You ask, "How much do people normally tip for something like this?" The artist looks up. "Its always gonna be about tree fiddy."

It was then that you realize the musician was a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era. The Loch Ness Monster almost tricked you!

There are only 2 guaranteed ways to tell if you are speaking to The Loch Ness Monster: A.) It is a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era B.) It will ask you for tree fiddy

Since Nessie is a master of disguise, the only way accurately tell is to look for the phrase "tree fiddy". Since you are tired of being grifted by this monster, the time has come to code a solution for finding The Loch Ness Monster. Note: It can also be written as 3.50 or three fifty.
  
  
  def is_lock_ness_monster(s):
    return any(i in s for i in ('tree fiddy', 'three fifty', '3.50'))
    
  print(is_lock_ness_monster())
  
  Question 92
  Create a function that finds the integral of the expression passed.

In order to find the integral all you need to do is add one to the exponent (the second number), and divide the coefficient by that new number (the first number).

In 3x^2, for example, the integral would be 1x^3 (we added 1 to the exponent, and divided the coefficient by that new number).

integrate(3,2) // => "1x^3"
integrate(12,5) // => "2x^6"
Note that the output should be a string. The coefficient is always positive, and the result will always be an integer. Neither number will ever be 0.

  
  def integrate(coef, exp):
    exp = exp + 1
    coef = coef / exp if coef % exp else coef // exp
    return f"{coef}x^{exp}"
    
  print(integrate(3x))
  
  Question 93
  In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

Examples
reverse_list([1,2,3,4]) == [4,3,2,1]
reverse_list([3,1,5,4]) == [4,5,1,3]


  def reverse_list(l):
    return l[::-1]
  
  print(reverse([1,2,3,4]))
  
  or
  
  def reverse_list(l):
    return list(reversed(l))
    
  print(reverse([1,2,3,4]))
  
  Question 94
  Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string.
  
  
  def remove_exclamation_marks(s):
    return s.replace("!", "")
  
  print(remove_exclamation_marks("hello World!"))
  
  Question 95
  Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. make the first character in the string "word" upper case).

Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.
  
  
  def capitalize_word(word):
    return word.capitalize()
    
  print(capitalize("table"))
  
  Question 96
  Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
Names given are always valid strings.

  
  def areYouPlayingBanjo(name):
    return "{} plays banjo".format(name) if name[0].lower() == "r" else "{} does not play banjo".format(name)
    
  print(areYouPlayingBanjo("Martin"))
  
  or 
  
  def areYouPlayingBanjo(name):
    if name[0].lower() == 'r':
        return name + ' plays banjo'
    else:
        return name + ' does not play banjo'
        
  print(areYouPlayingBanjo("Martin"))
  
  or
  
  def areYouPlayingBanjo(name):
    if name[0] == 'r' or name[0] =='R':
        return ("%s plays banjo"%name)
    else:
        return ("%s does not play banjo"%name)
        
  print(areYouPlayingBanjo("Martin"))
  
  Question 97
  All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.

Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.
  
  
  def feast(beast, dish):
    return beast[0] == dish[0] and beast[-1] == dish[-1]
    
  print(feast("great blue heron", "garlic naan"))
  
  Question 98
  Define a method hello that returns "Hello, Name!" to a given name, or says Hello, World! if name is not given (or passed as an empty String).

Assuming that name is a String and it checks for user typos to return a name with a first capital letter (Xxxx).

Examples:

hello "john"   => "Hello, John!"
hello "aliCE"  => "Hello, Alice!"
hello          => "Hello, World!" # name not given
hello ''       => "Hello, World!" # name is an empty String
  
  
  def hello(name=''):
    return "Hello, {}!".format(name.title() if name else 'World')
  
  print(hello())
